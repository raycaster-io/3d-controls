# camera-controls

A library of camera controls for Three.js.

The goal of this library is to provide a set of audited camera controls for Three.js, which could potentially play well with each other, be easily configurable, and extensible.

### Prior art

Inspiration for this work comes from the example controls from [Three.js examples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=controls).
